Q.1. What are the conditional operators in java?
Answer.-
Conditional operators are also known as ternary operators.it helps to perform a conditional assignment in a consise manner.
When condition consists of multiple boolean expression,conditional operators are used to combine two expressions 
Example :-
int age = 18;
String message = (age >= 18) ? "You are an adult" : "You are not an adult";
System.out.println(message);
 Three types are 
Logical-and Operator(&&)
 Logical-or Operator(||)
 Ternary operator(?:)

Q.2.What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Operators in programming languages can be categorized based on the number of operands they take. The common categorization includes the following:
1. Unary Operators: Unary operators work with a single operand.
 Examples:
 Increment   ++  
 Decrement   --  
 Unary minus    -
2. Binary Operators: Binary operators work with two operands.
Examples:
Arithmetic operators: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/),       Modulus/Remainder (%)
Relational operators: Equal to (==), Not equal to (!=), Greater than (>), Less than (<),           Greater than or equal to (>=), Less than or equal to (<=)
String concatenation operator (+)
3. Ternary Operator: The ternary operator is the only operator in Java that takes three operands.
 Example:
 Conditional operator (? :)

Q.3.What are the use of Switch case in java programing ?
Answer.-
The switch statement in Java is used for multi-branching based on the value of an expression. It provides an alternative to using multiple  if-else statements when a limited number of possible cases to be evaluated.
The main uses of the `switch` statement:
1. Multiple Branching: The switch statement allows to compare the value of a single expression with multiple cases and execute different blocks of code based on the matched case. It provides a concise way to handle a large number of possible values without writing a series of nested `if-else` statements.
2. Code Readability: When the logic involves a clear and straightforward comparison of a single value against multiple cases, the `switch` statement can make the code more readable and easier to understand compared to a series of `if-else` statements.

3. Efficiency: The `switch` statement is often more efficient than multiple `if-else` statements when there are many cases. 

Q.4.What are the priority level of arithmetic operation in java ?
Answer.-
In Java, arithmetic operations follow a specific order of precedence. Parentheses have the highest priority, followed by postfix and unary operators. Multiplicative operators come next, followed by additive operators. Shift operators, relational operators, equality operators, and bitwise operators have lower priority. The logical AND operator has lower priority than bitwise operators, and the logical OR operator has the lowest priority. If multiple operators have the same priority, the associativity determines the order of evaluation, with most operators being left-associative. It is important to understand operator precedence to ensure that expressions are evaluated correctly and to override the default order using parentheses when needed.

Q.5.What are conditional Statement and use of conditional statements in java ?
Answer.-Conditional statements in Java are used to control the flow of program execution based on certain conditions. They allow  to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. In Java, the main conditional statements are:
*  if  statement: The  if  statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. It can be followed by an optional  else  statement to specify an alternative block of code if the condition is false.
* if-else  statement: The  if-else  statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition of the  if  statement is false.
*   if-else if-else  statement: The  if-else if-else statement allows to test multiple conditions sequentially and execute the corresponding block of code based on the first condition that evaluates to true.
*   switch  statement: The  switch  statement evaluates an expression and executes different blocks of code based on the matched case. It provides an alternative to multiple  if-else if-else  statements when there are many possible cases to evaluate.

:-  The use of conditional statements in Java is crucial for making decisions and controlling the program's behavior based on specific conditions. They allow you to handle different scenarios, validate user input, perform branching, and create flexible and dynamic programs. By using conditional statements effectively, you can write code that responds to different conditions and produces the desired output or behavior.

Q.6. What is the syntax of if else statement ?
Answer.-
The syntax of if else statements is 
if (condition) {
    // Code block to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code block to be  executed if the condition is false
}

Q.7.What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java ?
Answer.-In Java, the three types of iterative statements, also known as loops, are:
1. The `for` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specified number of times. It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an increment or decrement statement. The loop continues as long as the condition is true.
2.  The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
3.  The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition. The condition is evaluated after each iteration of the loop.

Q.8.Write difference between for loop and do while loop ?
Answer.-In Java, a for loop and a do-while loop are two types of loop structures used for repetitive execution of code blocks. 
*  A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. The loop body executes only if the condition is true, and the update statement is executed after each iteration. If the condition is false initially, the loop body is not executed at all.

*  On the other hand, a do-while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and the loop body needs to be executed at least once. The condition is evaluated after executing the loop body. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed again; otherwise, the loop is terminated. The update statement is typically placed at the end of the loop body.

And we can say that the main difference between a for loop and a do-while loop is that the for loop checks the condition before executing the loop body, while the do-while loop checks the condition after executing the loop body.

Q.9.Write a program to print number from 1 to 10 ?
Answer.-The program to print the required range of numbers is 

public class NumberPrinter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
