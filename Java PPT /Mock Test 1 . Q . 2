2. Write a Java program to print the Fibonacci series up to a given number using a for loop.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Fibonacci {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci series: ");
        int input = scanner.nextInt();

        int idx1 = 0, idx2 = 1;

        System.out.print("Fibonacci Series: " + idx1 + " " + idx2);
        //loop starts i = 2 until given number,the first two terms are already printed.
        for (int i = 2; i < input; i++) {
            int nextIdx = idx1 + idx2;

            //first two terms are already printed remaining will print in this for loop.
            System.out.print(" " + nextIdx);
            
            //the value of idx1 and idx2 are updated for the next iteration.
            idx1 = idx2;
            idx2 = nextIdx;
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
